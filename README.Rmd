Knowing the estimated medical expenses in advance is very critical for insurance companies to set their yearly premiums to beneficiaries. They should make sure that the amount they spent on beneficiaries is less than the total premium they receive. Using a predictive model that predicts the expected medical expense of a customer, the insurance companies get an estimate of how much premium to charge on each segment of customers such that the cost results in reasonable profit to the company. Using such predictive models, they can identify potentially high-risk customers and charge a higher premium from such customers.  In this project, we attempt to build a regression model that will help us predict the medical expenses of a person given information such as age, sex, number of children, smoking habits, and the region where the person is from. In the process, we are also interested in figuring out if there is a significant difference in expenses between smokers and non-smokers, and between males and females. Our hypothesis tests suggest that at 0.05 significance level there is significant evidence to conclude that smokers incur more medical expenses than non-smokers. Also, there is statistically no significant evidence to conclude that the medical expenses of men and women are different. For our predictive model, after trying different regression models, we found that the decision tree regressor performs the best on our data. Using our final tuned model, we achieved satisfying results on the test data set, with a $R^2$ score of `r round(regression_error$test_data[4], 3)`. 

The Data we are using for this analysis is used in the book Machine Learning with R by Brett Lantz[@source]; which is a book that provides an introduction to machine learning using R. All of these datasets are in the public domain. The data explain the cost of a small sample of USA population Medical Insurance Cost based on attributes like age, sex, number of children etc. Additional information about this data can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/meperezcuello/82a9f1c1c473d6585e750ad2e3c05a41).
